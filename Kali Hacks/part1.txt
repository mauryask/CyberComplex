5: Since from kali 2020 the user is not set to root by default so how to setup root account
--> type following commands
>>  sudo su (switch to root)
>> enter current kali user password
>> passwd root
>> enter new password for root account and retype it
>> now logoff amd sign in as root
>> using user: root
>> password: whatever password you have created for root account

<<======================================>>

6: Importatnt thing to remember

>> $ : sign indicates that u are a low privilege user
>> # : this sign indicates that u are a super user (root user)

<<======================================>>

7: Package Management tool in kali

>> apt (advance packaging tool) : (Debian) kali linux package management tool
>> yum : Red hat Linux, Fedora etc has package management tool
 
>> apt-cahe search pkg_name : search for a package
>> apt-cache show pkg_name  : show information about a package
>> apt-get install pkg_name : to install a package
>> apt-get remove pkg_name  : remove an existing pakage (but it does not remove the configuration file : so that when u reinstall the
>> software u dont need to configure it)
>> apt-get purge pkg_name   : remove  package along with the configuration files
>> apt-get -y install pkg_name : this automatically installs the package (dos not ask for yes/no)
>> apt-get update           : updates the list of packages there versions from remote repos (that needed to be installed)
>> apt-get upgrade 	   : upgrade the whole distribution to a new version 
>> apt full-upgrade (apt-get dist-upgrade) : full upgrade the Distro

--> after Linux-2016 u dont even need to use (apt-get or apt-cache : just use "apt" 
because these two commands cobined into one after Linux-2016 -> apt)

>> apt autoremove : this will remove all the residual files(that remains in your system even after uninstalling a package)

<<-------------- But from where these package came from when u use apt command ------------>>

>> basically there are repositories for the software packages, when u issue apt commad it goes to that repos 
>> and finds the package for you 
--> u can see the source of these package using the following commands
>> cat /etc/apt/sources.list

<<--------------
sometimes software may not be found in the apt repos 
or considere a case when you hacked a kali machine and you connested to it as non-root user 
or consider a situation the machine you broke into may not have internet connection 
now what is the solution if you want to install softwares in such cases
------------>>

>> dpkg -l : to see the details of all the softwares installed in it (eg. version)
>> dpkg -i package.deb : install a package
>> dpkg -r package.deb : remove a package

<<======================================>>

8: to see last 500  comands you executed 
>> less .bash_history  or
>> cat .bash_history

<<======================================>>

9: know about your shell
>> cat  /etc/shells : (show all the available shells on your system)
>> echo $SHELL : name of your shell (u r working on)

<<======================================>>

10: see docuentation of a commad
>> man command_name
>> command_name --help 
>> info command_name
>> command_name -h

<<======================================>>

11:
>> cal : shows the calander
>> date : shows the currnt date


<<======================================>>

12: interacting with the VI (text editor)
>> vi file_name : create and open a file in vi text editor
>> ESC + SHIFT + I > to go into edit mode
>> ESC -> to go into comand mode

>> : w > save a file
>> : wq > save and quit file or
>> : x > same as above
>> : q > quit file
>> : line_number > to go on a specific line
>> : /string to search > search for a string


<<======================================>>

13: Archivig and comression the files (taking a backup)
> archiving : if you archive 20MB file it will remain of the same size
> compression : on compressing a file reduces its size hence cost reduced

> archiving tool

> tar (tape archive)

>> tar c : create archive
>> tar r : append archive
>> tar t : list the contents of the archive
>> tar x : Extract archive
>> tar v : verbose
>> tar f file : file to use


> Compressing tools

> gzip : Classical compresion in the linux
> bzip2 : more advance compression than gzip (reduce size more than gzip but more time needed to compress)

>> d : decompression

>> tar cvf archive_file_name.tar fil1 file2 file3 dir  : create the archive file
>> tar tvf archive_file_name.tar : it shows the contents of the archive file
>> tar rvf archive_file_name.tar file1 : add file to archive
>> tar rvf archive_file_name.tar dir1 : add directory to the archive
>> tar xvf archive_file.tar  file1.txt : extract a single file
>> tar xvf archive.tar : extract every thing
>> tar xvf archive.tar dir1/test.txt  : extrat test.txt file from a directory
>> tar xvf archive.tar -C ~/Desktop  :  extract files in another directroy

<-------------  Archive and Compress  ------------>
>> tar zcvf archive.tar.gz file1 file2 dir1 dir2
>> tar jcvf archive.tar.bz2 file1 file2 dir1 dir2 
>> tar ztvf archive.tar.gz : list the content of compressed file
>> similiarly for 'jcvf' 
>> you can not add new files and directories into compressed file : tar zrvf archive.tar.gz filex.txt (not allowed)
>> tar zxvf archive.tar.gz : extract the files
>> tar zxvf archive.tar.gz -C ~/Desktop : extract the files in another folder

<<======================================>>
<--------- Compressing the file ------------>
Using bzip2
>> bzip2 file_name (compression)
>> bzip2 -d file_name.bz2 (decompression)

Using gzip
>> gzip file_name
>> gzip -d file_name

>> Using 'zip' command to compress and decompress the files and folders
>> zip [options] [zip_file_name] [fikles and folders to zip]
Deleting a file from the zipped.zip file
>> zip -d [my_zip.zip] [test.txt] -> test.txt file will be deleted from the my_zip.zip
adding files to the zip archive
>> zip -u my_zip.zip [new_file.txt]
Remove files and delete directory if empty
>> zip -m my_zip.zip *.c -> if folder containg these files becomes empty then folder will automatically deleted
>> zip -r my_zip.zip [dir_name] -> recursively zip a directory
>> zip -x my_zip.zip [file_to_excluse] -> zip everyting except given file
>> zip -v my_zip [files] -> see verbose as well
>> List the files and folders without extracting it
>> zipinfo [zip-file-name]
Unzip the file
>> unzip [zipped_file.zip]

<<======================================>>

14: Wild Cards 
>> * : match 0 or more characters
>> ? : match exactly one chatacter
>> [] : match charcters within the braces
>>\ : escape

<<======================================>>

15: tree command (if this command does not exist install it >> apt-get install tree)
>> tree : this command lists all the contents of directories in a more graphical way
>> tree . : do the same as above 

<<======================================>>

16: Getting Help
>> file file_name : this commad gives information about the file (like format, type etc)
>> apropos commnd_name : this tells that what you can do with a given commad
>> man -k command_name : find all the manual associate with the given keywrod (command)
>> commad_name --help : list of options you can use iwth this command
>> command_name -h : do the same task as above
>> man command_name : open manual of a command
>  use up and down arrows to go up and down in the manual
>  use 'shift + G' key to go down at once
>  use 'G' key to go up at once  

> search for a keyword in the manual : type
>> /key_word : hit enter
>  use 'Shift + N' to get into previous one
>  use 'N' to get into  next one
>  press 'Q' to close the manual 

 
<<======================================>>

17: Locate a file (find a file)
>> locate file_name : this commands gives the full path of the file if it exist
>  example --> locate unix_password.txt : this file is a huge dictionary of the passwords


<<======================================>>

18: count the elements in a file
>> wc  file_name   : prints number of lines, words and bytes
>> wc -l file_name : prints the number of lines a file
>> wc -w file_name : number of words
>> wc -c file_name : number of bytes in a file
>> wc -m file_name : number of characters in file
>> wc -L file_name : prints only the length of the longest line in a file
