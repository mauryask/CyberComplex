1: Networking Basic (You will understand this after completing the networking course)

>> Network Intefaces:
> How your comuter is connected to a network (name of intefaces)
> eth0  : wired network interface
> wlan0 : wireless network interface
> lo    : loop back address (home or localhost : 127.0.0.1 or ::1)

<<======================================>>

2: find your Ip address
>> ifconfig : gives your ip address
>> nslookup website_name : get the (name)address of "your" the dns server (to which DNS srever you are communicating with)
>> Anoter way to get the name of your DNS server by looking into file '/etc/resolv.conf' file
>> cat /etc/resolv.conf

<<======================================>>

3: find out the gateway that your packets are going through
> ip route 
>> see what are the services are running by the host
> netstat -antp > a, n, t,p are options here  (did niot get this command exactly)

<<======================================>>

4: editing a file 
>> kali has many text editors available into it
>  vi, vim, emacs : (these are more advance editors) 
>  nano, pico : these are less powerful than above
> editing with nano
>> ctrl + W : to sreach a word in forward direction
>> alt + W : to go to next searched word

>> innano text editor :  (^)-> CTRL & (M) -> ALT keys

<<======================================>>

5: Baisc Service Configuration
>  There are various services availbale in Kali linux
>> SSH (secure shell) : used for remote login and remote administration
(so if u are some where else on the internet u can use SSH to login to another linux system)
>> Apache : Web Server

<------------- Post Exploitation Tip ---------------->
>> After compromising a host you can upload or download files using 
>> Apache, SSH, SCP (Secure copy) services

> Turning Kali into a web server (starting Apche server)
>> service apache2 start   : this starts the apache server
>> service apache2 restart : this restarts the apache server
>> service apache2 stop    : this stops the apache server
>> service apache2 status : check whether running or stopped
>> all the web files are stored in : "/var/www/html" directory 

>> echo  "some Text" > filename : this command going to store the test into specified file_name
-> this is called command redirection

<----------------  Amazing, I surprised to see this  ------------------>
>> Now you can access this file from any other machine 
just by using th IP of this machine (192.168.93.43/downloadme)

<<======================================>>

6: wget : this commad is used to download a file from a server (system) over http and https protocol
>> example : wget http://192.168.43.93/downloadme (this will download this file into your system)
>> wget https://iamannitian.co.in/index.php : this will download index.php file

<<======================================>>

7: modifying the SSH configuration file
>> By default the SSH is not accessible as root privilage to get root access change following file
>  "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file
>  Uncomment the line : PermitRootLogin yes <-- write yes infront of the line by removing the prewritten word 
> now ssh sever is accessible with root privilage
>> service ssh start
>> type root password (and ssh is started)


<!------->
Login remotely from a linux PC to another linux pc
>> ssh 192.168.43.93
> enter root password (if you want to login as root)
> else specify the user name with password (see the commands below)
>> ssh kali@192.168.43.93 
>> enter kali(user password)

<<======================================>>
> scp(secure copy) a tool used to copy remote files to local machine and vice-versa
> learn how to use scp on kali


<<======================================>>

8: Managing Users and Groups

>> Post Exploitation Tip (after compromising a host you can find who you are (root or low privilage user))
>> also you can check to which group you belong

<------------------------>
>> In linux every user is assigned a ID
>  root user id : 0
>> when you create a new user the then the ID starts from 1000, 1001.. and so on   
>> By default every time when you create a new user it belongs to the
a group with the same name is created as the username and user belongs to this newly created group

> whoami : this commnd gives the user name (like root, kali etc whatever user you are)


<<======================================>>

9: if you want to see who is login cureently and what he is doing (his history of usage)
> w : type simply 'w' command

<<======================================>>

10: to see list of user on this system (open the passwd file)
>> cat /etc/passwd : here most of the users are added by default 

> note : here the user who holds -> /bin/bash  >> can access the machine (means can login remotly : but not others)

>> to see the encrypted passwords of the users (open shadow file : remember only root user can access this file)
> cat /etc/shadow : this will show your passwords of all the users In encrypted format

>> you can decypt these hashes and compromise the host (find the way to decrypt it : not taught by the tutor)

<<======================================>>

11: finding the group to which a user belongs

>> id : shows the uid, groupid and gropu name the current user belongs
>> groups user_name : this command will show to which group a user belongs
>> cat /etc/group : this command show the list of the groups

<<======================================>>

12: adding and deleting the user
>> adduser [user_name] : create a new user inside the home directory
>> useradd [user_name] : create a new user outside the home directory

>> switching between the users
> su [user_name] : switch from current user to specified user
 
<!------------> Deleting Users
>> userdel [user_name] : Delete the user from the (/etc/passwd), but the home directory associated with the user exists

>> deluser --remove-home [user_name] : this deletes the user_name and associated home directory as well

<<======================================>>

13: Creating  new group and changing the groupof an existing user
>> addgroup [group_name]  : creates a new group with this name
>> usermod -g [group_name] [user_name] : change the user group from the current group to new group (here : group_name)

<!-------------------->
>> Deleting a group
>> sudo delgroup [group_name] : this command deletes a group
>> sudo groupdel [group_name]
<<======================================>>

14: Manging user permissions
>> (Post Exploitation Tip : after managing  a host you can find the files and directories with weak permisions)
>> and could inject potentially malicious code into them

--->Permissions
> r --> read only : you can see the content (allows listing the content)
> w --> write only : you can modify (create, move, remove the file and directory)
> x --> execute only : you can run the files as the program (allows accessing files in the directory)

---> Permisson Options
> u --> user (owner : gives permissions to the current users)
> g --> group assigned to file and dirrcetory (it gives permission to the group to which the currennt user belongs)
> o --> other (who do not belong to current group to which owner belongs )
> a --> all (u, g, o)

---> Opertations
> + --> add permission
> - --> remove permission
> = --> make this the only permission (all other permissions will be removed)
>> chmod u=x [file_name] (if user has read, write, execute permissions then he will have only execute permission)

---> Commands : chomd (change mode command)
> chmod + 

>> remeber in the directories 

>> drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 2048 Jun 12 07:17 Desktop

> rwx : this is the permissions for the current user
> r-x : permissions for the group (1st r-x)
> r-x : permissions for the others
> root : (1st root is owner)
> root : (2nd root is group name)

>> -rw-------  1 root root 32216 Jun 20 06:33 .xsession-errors

> rw : permission for the owner (root)

>> sudo -l : list the processes that could be run as root privilage 


<============ /etc/sudoers file ==============>
>> this file contains info regarding which user contains which permission

------------------>>>> Commands

>> chmod g+w file_name : this will give write permission to all the users belongin to current group
>> chmod guoa+rwx : this will give read write and execute permission to all the users

---------> Post exploitation tip
>> after compromising a host you will check which programs you can run as the root
>> and check for the vulnerabilities in thise files
>> 

<<======================================>>

15:  Process Management in Kali Linux 
>> in linux every process has a unique ID 
>> every prorss is associated with user and group
>> process running by root will have more access rights as compare to other users
>> 

<<======================================>>
> Commaands
>> ps : list the process for the current session
>> ps -f : list prorss with full formating (mean gives additional information about the process
by which user it is being executed)
>> ps -e : list all the process (every process inclusing the background processes)
>> ps -u user_name : list processes of a specific user
>> ps -p process_id : display information about process having id "process_id"  

>> Killing or terminating the processes

>> kill process_id : to kill a specific process (suppose the process is not responding)
>> kill -9 process_id : terminate the process forecfully (use this if no option is woring : because this may harm your system)
>> ctrl + C : stop the cureently running process

>> Example: open two terminal one as root and another as blackhatos 
--> run ping command on blackhatos terminal
--> in the root terminal list the processes being executed by blackhatos 
--> kill process_id_of_ping 
--> now this will terminate the process in the blackhatos terminal
--> similiarly if blackahtos is running putty (remotely accesing the system)
--> root can terminate the processes being executed by the blackahtos


>> Fun with background process
--> comman_name & : this runs the process in the background

Another way to execute a process in background
>> run your command >> then press ctrl + Z >> type bg 
>> now this process is running in the background (check it by typing jobs command) 


--> jobs : this command list all the processess running ion the background
--> fg [n] : take the process in foreground , n : is the process number not pid

One more way to run a process in the background
>> use a tool : tmux 
>> type tmux : this will take you to a different terminal
>> run your command what ever you want 
>> press CTRL + B (press and leave) then press D (separately): to detach from tmux
(or type 'tmux detach' by splitting the current terminal)
>> tmux list-sessions (or 'tmux ls'): lists all the running sessions in the background
>> to reattach to the the tnux terminal agian use >> tmux attach : this will take you to the tmux again

--> Advance tmux commands

>> tmux new -s session_name
>> tmux attach -t 0(session_number)
>> tmux attach -t seesion_name
>> tmux kill-session -t session_name
>> tmux kill-session -t 0(session_number)

Running backgroud process (advnance command)

>> nohup command_name & : the command will keep executing even if the session is terminated

<<======================================>>
Command redirection and control output
Suppose you want to save the output of a command into a file
>> ping google.com > ping.txt
>> dirb https://facebook.com > dirb.txt
Suppose you have multiple file of usernames and you want to combine it into one single file
>> cat user1.txt user2.txt user3.txt > all-user.txt
Remember this command is going to overrride the contet of the file if already exists
So to solve this problem (if we want to append the output to the preexisting content of the file)
>> cat user4.txt >> all-user.txt
>> cat -n all-user.txt (this commad will show you numbering on each line)

<<======================================>>
Piping the commands
Suppose there is folder having large number of contents (files/folders)
and you want to see it (for example nmap scripts)
>> ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | less
If you want to see only specific programs (files/folders)
This command will only display the files where kryword match
>> ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep [keyword] (e.g. brute)

<<======================================>>
Advance usage of 'grep' command
>> grep [key_word] ['file_name] -> to show the content based on the keyword

>> grep [key_word] [file_name] | cut -d " " -f 2
-> this command going to give you the second field in a
-> row column based data e.g [A B C D E F G H I J] 
-> the out put is going to be second column

>> grep [key_word] [file_name] | cut -d " " -f 2 | sort -u 
-> this command is going to give the unique entris of the second column
-> of the above output

>> grep [key_word] [file_name] | cut -d " " -f 2 | sort -u > filtered-result.txt
-> saving the output in a file using command redirection technique
-> try these commands on the resources given in the tutorials
